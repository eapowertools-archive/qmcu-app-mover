This QMC Utilities plugin will allow users to export apps out of an environment and move them to other Qlik Sense environments.


###Usage

To use the app-mover plugin with QMC Utilities, you simply need the certificates from all the machines you want to pull apps from, and push apps to. You need the \*.abs, \*.asb, \*.asb files which you can find in the `C:\ProgramData\Qlik\Sense\Repository\Exported Certificates\.Local Certificates` on each Qlik server.
